# PHP Silent Errors: Undefined Array Keys

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP: the silent handling of undefined array keys.  Accessing a non-existent array key doesn't result in a clear error message; instead, PHP returns NULL, which can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in calculations.

The `bug.php` file shows examples of this behavior, and `bugSolution.php` offers solutions to mitigate this problem.  The solutions focus on preventing silent failures and ensuring code robustness.
